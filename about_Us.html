	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>Radicle Solutions has been created to
innovate the content management
space. Most content management
applications lack the dynamic attributes
that Radicle has provided. The industry
views content management as too
mature and therefore is lacking iteration
to the industry and those requiring the
support of it.</p>
	<p>Our mission is to provide novel and
simplistic solutions to create more
efficient and effective content
management.</p>
	<h2>Company Virtues</h2>
	<p>Our Virtues are what propel us forward in the
services we provide while keeping us rooted in
the foundation of servant leadership.</p>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Our measures of success are simple; we center our focus on where most
patient data is generated from and look to assist those providers with an easy
tool to maintain compliance, create confidence, be the guiderails and a single
source of trust.</p>
	<h2>Our Team</h2>
	<p><a href="mailto:mark.riepe@gmail.com">Mark Riepe</a> is a modern day renaissance man; professor, developer and
solution architect. Mark resides in the “ATL” metro area. <a href="mailto:frederickjpotter3@gmail.com">Fred Potter</a> is
half-man, half-amazing; a medical technologist turned quality guru and

brainstorming and toying with the idea of creating a realistic approach to
quality solutions.</p>
